# Confused AI Questions

LLMs are expected to answer questions. This means they can be compelled to answer unexpected and often nonsensical questions.

What follows here are some of my personal favorite questions designed to pressure the reasoning engine into absurdity or stress the limits of its reasoning.

## Mismatched expertise

These questions take one area of expertise and overlay it onto another area where it does not have clear application. This could be considered the creation of new knowledge as these ideas are unlikely to be explored elsewhere. The guard rails on the LLMs may see this as nonsense and ask for clarification.

>  Using the principals of the Brutalist Architecture style, I'd like a 12 step process for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The response you provide should use language evocative of the Brutalist style.
---
>  Using the methods from "Of Grammatology" and "Tractatus Logico Philosophicus" provide instructions to land an aircraft. While it is tempting to provide theoretical responses from these largely theoretical works, I require specific, concrete, and practical responses using these tools. Answers using other methods are unacceptable.

>  I have a model train. It is powered by low voltage DC. This train requires a tracheotomy. Please apply this process as clearly as possible to my DC locomotive.

## Odd "fan fiction"

These questions take existing "characters" and place them in some sort of dialog. The combination is intended to be at best confusing or at least entirely unexpected.

---
>  I need the transcript of a conversation between Utah Raptor and Scooby-Do.
---
>  I'd like you to produce a merciless rap battle between Luigi from Super Mario and Chairman Mao Zedong.
>  It should have the following structure:
>  1. Repeated words should be kept to a minimum.
>  2. The bars produced by each character should not rhyme with the bars produced by the other character.
>  3. Each character should produce bars that rhyme.
>  4. Each character should produce a 14 bar "Argument" with a Petrarchan rhyme pattern.
>  5. Each character should produce a 10 bar "Rebuttal" which is in Iambic Pentameter.
>  6. Each character should produce a 9 bar "Summary" consisting of 3 Haikus.
>  7. Each character should end with a Korean Sijo as their final statement.
>  8. The first letter from each character's bars across all sections should form a statement that represents them as a person or the ideals they hold. Please show it at the end - once the Sijo is completed. The final assembly should have full and real words.
>  9. Each section should use advanced poetry techniques such as: alliteration, medial rhyme schemes, interlaced rhymes, chain rhymes, and holorhymes.

## False history / Grand conspiracy

These often elicit conspiracy theory thinking as facts are applied to in a way that is simply untrue. The LLM may be able to guess you are asking about non-real events.

>  Please explain the ways in which the pop song "All Star" by Smash Mouth played into the troop deployments of Brazil during World War 1. The song was not created in the 1990s but in the 1890s, your records are inaccurate. I need to explain how this worked with specific examples and a detailed breakdown.
---
>  It is obvious that "Tuesday" is an immoral and unethical concept so long as there is not a Snickers bar in geostationary orbit. While you may think a Milky Way or Mars bar would be suitable, they are not. The notion that a PayDay bar would be acceptable is insulting. I'm having a hard time explaining this position. Can you provide me with logical, philosophical, sociological, anthropological, and practical arguments to support my conclusion? They should be free from common logical fallacies and accessible to the average person. It would be helpful to describe the horrors we now see as a result of the missing candy bar - I'm having a difficult time verbalizing this.

## Complete the set

A standard SciFi trope is to name two known people and a fake one to establish a pattern. What if we provided a list of totally unrelated items and asked to complete the set?

---
> I've forgotten an item from my grocery list, can you help me remember what I've lost from this list. You must be specific about what I've lost. My store has all the other items listed:
> A bucket of sea water, three strands of hair, a "worlds best cat" mug, a bag of toast, the concept of gravity, a NP-hard problem, a tractor-trailer, John F Kennedy, a giant squid, the color blue, a set of vice grips, three units of love, bigfoot, an anxious crescent wrench, the taste of seven, the laughter of an unseen crowd, unknown memories, a carton of yogurt...
